									<h3>What is UX/UI Design?</h3>
									<p><strong>User Experience (UX):</strong> The process of planning the "experience"
									a person has when interacting with a product. They focus on the usage of the product and
									or service to be digitally/physically easy, logical and fun! UX Designers must find out
									WHO their users are (user persona) and create something that works well for them.
									</p>
									<p><strong>User Interface (UI):</strong> UI Designers design the aesthetics of a digital product, the look
										and feel. They focus on the visual touchpoints like color palette, typography, buttons, animations,
										etc. UI Designers are basically the graphic designers who aim to create a product interface that is aesthetic
										and easy to use!
									</p>
									<h4 style="font-style: italic;">Simply, it is the UI Designer's job to bring a UX Designer's ideas to life!</h4>
									<br>
									<h3>Why UX/UI Design?</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>It is an <strong>in-demand</strong> career where large industries and start-ups are looking for UX/UI Designers, especially for websites and apps!</li>
										<li>The <strong>salary</strong> for UX/UI Designers start at around $77,108 for entry-level designers, and it only increases from there (varies from experience/location)!</li>
										<li>UX/UI Design <strong>skills</strong> were cited as the top skills in 2021 by LinkedIn! Through experience, you can build lots of soft skills that are applicable to many other careers.</li>
